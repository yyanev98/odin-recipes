            <h2>Ingridients</h2> 
                 <ul>
                    <li>4 eggs</li>
                    <li>400 g yoghurt</li>
                    <li>100 g Feta cheese, crushed</li>
                    <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp red pepper, paprika</li>
                    <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                 </ul>
            
                 
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                 <ol>
                    <li>Put a saucepan of water and a little salt on the hob. Add 3-4 tbsp vinegar and bring to a boil. Once the water has boiled, pull the pan away from the heat.</li>
                    <li>Break the eggs one at a time into a cup to make sure they are not spoiled. Pour the first egg into the hot water from low, then put the second, third and fourth. Return the pan to the heat over a quiet heat, not letting it boil hard. Leave like this for 2-3 minutes. If you want the eggs to be firmer, not rot, cook for 5 minutes. Remove the veiled eggs with a slotted spoon, dip them in a bowl of cold water to remove the taste of the vinegar. And put two on each plate over the cheesy milk.</li>
                    <li>While the eggs are boiling, crush the cheese, add the yogurt and crushed garlic. Stir and spread in 2 serving plates.</li>
                    <li>In a frying pan, heat the butter and oil. Once the butter has melted, add the paprika and stir. Do not cook the paprika on the hob, because it will get a bitter taste.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle the warm paprika over the eggs.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with freshly chopped fresh parsley.</li>
                    <li>Bon app!</li>

                 </ol>
